# RainbowQuest

- A beat saber quest mod that makes things go rainbow :D
- Each side is kept as opposite colours, and walls are set randomly.
- This mod fades all the colours through rainbow. Fun!

## Settings

- Rainbow Enabled: turn the mod on or off 
- Rainbow Speed: how fast the colours fade, recommended 0.4 or 0.5

## Notes

- I highly reccomend turning the mod off via settings when playing chroma maps, as my mod can do broken weird things with the colours on chroma maps.
- This mod is best on single saber maps, but adds a bit of a challenge to all maps.
- Due to a bug, you need to toggle the settings menu on the first time, and toggle it off and back on again after that. trying to fix this.
- The lights of some maps will change colours as well, some don't, working on this as well.
- Also working on making the sabers fade with the notes.

## ToDo

- [ ] Fix settings menu
- [ ] Make all map lights fade
- [ ] Make sabers fade
